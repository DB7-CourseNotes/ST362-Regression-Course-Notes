## About This Course

This book contains the course notes for the Spring 2023 offering of ST362 Regression Analysis, based on the following sources:

- *Applied Regression Analysis*, 3rd edition, by Draper and Smith 
    - A PDF of this textbook is available through the WLU library
- *Introduction to Linear Regression Anaysis*, 2nd edition, by Montgomery and Peck
    - This textbook is excellent but expensive, and I am striving to use free and OER materials.
- The online course notes from [Stat 501](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/1) at Penn State.

## About This Book

Some features:

- The GitHub logo takes you to the repo for this book. Feel free to fork and adapt as you please (under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license).
- The little toggle next to the logo puts this into night mode. Try it out!
- Each lecture had a "Jam", where I played music at the start of class that related to a particular slide. When that slide showed up, a student would say "That's my Jam!" and I would throw chocolate at them. 
    - The jams are still there, and you may wish to listen to them while reading the slides!

This book is very much a work in progress. There are missing sections and typos in the slides. I am working on adding speaker notes to the slides, which will show up as text in this book. 

I am also working on a major re-write of the first few chapters to walk through the concepts in a better order. In particular, I would like to stay in simple linear regression for a lot longer, demonstrating correlation, Cook's distance, correlation between $\hat\beta_0$ and $\hat\beta_1$, etc., then moving into binary and categorical predictors as a first step into multiple regression, polynomial as a second step, then a lecture demonstrating that all of these concepts generalize into multiple dimensions. 

This is a quarto book based on my lecture slides. The "Lectures" are quarto files that were rendered into beamer PDF slides. I have included the configs to render the slides. To re-create my slides, you can use the code:

```bash
quarto render L01-Introduction.qmd --profile slides
```

The `--profile` argument tells Quarto to use the configuration in the file `_quarto-slides.yml`. I will add speaker notes in a `notes` environment, which means that the notes will appear in the book but not the pdf slides.
