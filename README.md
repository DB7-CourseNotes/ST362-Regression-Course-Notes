# Course Notes for ST362

Based on the textbook Applied Regression Analysis, 3rd edition, by Norman R. Draper and Harry Smith.

Currently, this repo is just a dump for the slides and R notebooks, but it will be expanded to have speaker notes that students can use.

I am also working on adding [Shiny Apps](https://topepo.github.io/shinylive-in-book-test/) directly into the chapters. We'll see how this goes.
